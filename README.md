BMI Calculator project for Python internship
Oasis Infobyte: BMI Calculator Project

Hey there! This is a first sneak peek into the Python Programming Internship at Oasis Infobyte, and this project is my starting point.

Project at a glance
A straightforward Command-Line BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. It helps you quickly see which health bracket you fall into based on height and weight.

What makes it work
- User-friendly prompts: Clear, simple guidance to steer you along.
- Smooth input handling: It won’t crash if you toss in words or negative numbers—it's built to be forgiving.
- Quick categorization: BMI is instantly mapped to Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.
- Stay in flow: Keep calculating without having to restart.

How the math stacks up
BMI = weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

How to try it
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Grab the bmi_calculator.py file.
3. Open a terminal or VS Code and run:
   python bmi_calculator.py

Internship reflections
Working on this project unlocked some Python basics—like while loops and try-except blocks for handling errors—and reinforced the importance of writing clear, human-friendly code.
